# Assignment_9 - Java
 UCT Computer Science Assignment
### Question 1 [40 marks]
Write a program called Question1.java to store some details of computer boxes (serial
number, manufacturer, colour, amount of memory), screens (serial number, manufacturer,
colour, size) and accessories (serial number, manufacturer, colour) in a single list, with the
options of listing all parts or deleting a particular part.
<br/><br />
Your program must continuously prompt the user to choose an option from a list and act on
that option, until the exit option is chosen. See the sample output below. If a part is not
found, output "Not found" instead of "Done".
You must use inheritance and polymorphism to model your Box, Screen and Accessory classes
(use those exact class names) as subclasses of the same base class, which forms the basis for
the list.
<br/><br />
Note: Be very careful to reproduce the output exactly. Copy-and-paste is highly
recommended to avoid minor typographical errors that drive you crazy when submitting
online! However, pay attention to the differences in character encodings between PDF and
your IDE.

### Question 2 [60 marks]
Write a program to manage a set of graphical objects based on the commands in a specified
file. This is a graphical equivalent of the famous edlin tool for text manipulation.

On the Vula page of the assignment, you will find VectorGraphics and Question2
classes that will handle the file I/O for you. When you run Question2, specify the file name
like this:
